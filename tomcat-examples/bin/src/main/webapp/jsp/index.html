				Samples</font> </font> </b>
	<p>This is a collection of samples demonstrating the usage of
		different parts of the Java Server Pages (JSP) specification. Both JSP
		2.0 and JSP 1.2 examples are presented below.
	<p>
		These examples will only work when these pages are being served by a
		servlet engine; of course, we recommend <a
			href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat</a>. They will not work if
		you are viewing these pages via a "file://..." URL.
	<p>
		To navigate your way through the examples, the following icons will
		help: <br>&nbsp;
	<table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=5 WIDTH="85%">
		<tr>
			<td colspan="3">Comet processing example&nbsp;<br /> Example
				that demonstrates asynchronous request processing using Comet API.
				See <strong>"Advanced IO"</strong> chapter in the User Guide for
				details. It works only with connectors that support Comet processing
				(<strong>APR</strong> or <strong>NIO</strong> <strong>HTTP</strong>
				connectors).</td>
		</tr>
		<tr VALIGN=TOP>
			<td>Comet Chat&nbsp;</td>
